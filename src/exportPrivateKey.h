/**
 * Handles the export of private keys that are allowed to leave the device.
 * The export paths are restricted so that the method cannot access any account paths.
 * @param p1 has to be 0x00 for export of PRF key for decryption, 0x01 for export of PRF key for
 * recovering credentials and 0x02 for export of PRF key and IdCredSec.
 * @param p2 If set to 0x01, then the seeds are exported (Using this is deprecated). If set to 0x02,
 * then the BLS keys are exported. 0x00 is not used to ensure that old clients fail when calling
 * this functionality.
